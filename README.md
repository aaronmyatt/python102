Python workshop materials


## Getting Started:

1) Get Python installed, my preference is to use Conda: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python
2) With Conda installed, use it to install Jupyter Notebooks: `conda install jupyter` (entered into your terminal/console)
> We use Jupyter Notebooks to more conveniently experiment with and learn Python
3) Clone or download this repository
4) Navigate to the respository directory with your terminal/console
5) Activate Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook .` This will open a browser page reflecting the directory structure.

And we're ready to go!
